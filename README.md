# Fake Store API Integration

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) to build a simple e-commerce application. It fetches product data from the API and showcases functionalities like product listing, filtering, and possibly a shopping cart (depending on implementation). The goal was to practice API integration, front-end development, and state management in a real-world scenario.

## Features
- **Product Listing**: Displays a catalog of products fetched from the Fake Store API.
- **Product Details**: View detailed information about each product.
- **Category Filtering**: Filter products by categories (e.g., electronics, clothing).
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Tech Stack
- **API**: Fake Store API (https://fakestoreapi.com/)
- **Tools**: 
  - Fetch API for HTTP requests
  - Git for version control
